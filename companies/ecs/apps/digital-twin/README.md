## What This Is

A fully interactive strategic pitch deck, built as a web experience, proposing a **Digital Twin of ECS's intermodal supply chain**.

ECS operates across 35+ European countries — truck, rail, ferry and customs in a single ecosystem. The pitch argues that ECS's biggest untapped advantage is the operational data it already generates, and that a digital twin would turn that data into a proactive decision engine.

## The Problem

| Pain Point | Today | With Digital Twin |
|---|---|---|
| **Fragmented visibility** | Truck, rail, ferry, customs live in separate systems — decisions travel through inboxes | One source of truth. Every stakeholder sees the same picture, always |
| **Reactive decisions** | A ferry delay, customs hold or rail issue is handled after the fact — optimal window is already closed | Disruptions detected in seconds, optimal fallback ranked and actioned before impact |
| **Unused data** | Years of TMS, ERP and carrier data captured but rarely used to simulate or predict | Every historical decision trains the model — the system gets sharper every week |

## The Idea: Three Pillars

## Impact

> *Directional estimates based on comparable intermodal digital-twin programs in Europe and North America.*

| KPI | Baseline | Target | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **On-Time Delivery** | 95% | 98%+ | ↑ +3pp |
| **Empty Kilometres** | Current network | — | ↓ 12–18% |
| **CO₂ per Container** | Current mix | — | ↓ 8–15% |
| **Customer ETA Calls** | High volume | — | ↓ 40% |

---

## What-If Simulator

The site includes an **interactive scenario simulator** — pick a disruption and see the before/after:

| Scenario | Without Twin | With Twin | Time Saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ferry delayed 4h** | 4 hours of manual rebooking across 3 systems | Auto-detected → ranked fallback → approved in 9 min | **3h 46m** |
| **Rail at capacity** | Manual load assessment + spot broker outreach + missed windows | 8 loads auto-identified, pre-approved broker triggered | **4h 22m** |
| **Customs hold** | Reactive scramble, customer calls, credits issued | Flagged 36h in advance, rerouted before it hits | **36h advance** |

  ✦ CSRD sustainability reporting
  ✦ Full network coverage
```

## Why Now

**EU CSRD 2026** — Sustainability reporting mandatory for mid-size firms. CO₂-per-shipment data will no longer be optional. ECS needs this infrastructure now.

**AI tooling is mature** — Two years ago this required a dedicated ML team. Today, modern APIs, open-source simulation libraries and LLM-powered planning tools make this buildable with a small, focused team inside 12 months.

**Structural moat** — Every intermodal competitor is still reactive. The first operator to run a live digital twin builds a cost and service advantage that compounds every quarter.

---

## Data Architecture

The twin is built on feeds ECS **already generates** — no new data collection needed in phase one.

| Source | Type | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| TMS / ERP exports | Booking, routing, invoicing | Phase 1 |
| Carrier & vessel APIs | P&O, DFDS, rail operator feeds | Phase 1 |
| Customs & port systems | PLDA, port community platforms | Phase 2 |
| Weather & disruption feeds | External real-time risk signals | Phase 2 |
| Customer ETA portal | Proactive shipment visibility | Phase 3 |

---

## ECS by the Numbers

| | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **35+** countries | **6K+** weekly loads | **45%** land on rail | **95%+** on-time | **170K** sqm warehousing | **104 Kt** CO₂ saved/yr |
